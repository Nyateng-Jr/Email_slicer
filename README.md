# Email_slicer
This is a Python code consisting of a single function called main() 
That collects an email address from the user, splits it into username, domain, and extension. The username is the part before the @ symbol, the domain is the part between @ and the first dot, and the extension is the part after the first dot, using the split() method.
The code then prints out these three parts.
Otherwise if the user enters "quit" the program ends.
